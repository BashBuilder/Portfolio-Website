        <h4>Web Developer</h4>
        <p> I am a web developer and coding student. If you are wondering why i like coding! it's because my hobbies include art and science and well those two dont get along so well, until i discovered coding and web design. To me it felt like the perfect combination of art and science which made my interest in coding grow.</p>

        <h4>Artist</h4>
        <p> I am a very good artist if i do say so myself. It all started when my class mate obiolonma started winning over my friends with her art even though i wasn good in art everyone tought obiolonma was better, so i challenged her to a competition and i won making everyone think i was better after all, and since then i concidered my self an artist and started to sell my art.</p>
